# Real Estate Scam Checker: Blockchain-Based Land Registration and Transaction System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a blockchain-based land registration and transaction system that leverages the immutability, transparency, and security features of blockchain technology to manage property ownership and transactions. The system will address issues related to land ownership disputes, transaction authenticity, and regulatory compliance by providing a decentralized platform for property registration, ownership verification, and conflict resolution.

## Objectives

- [ ] **Ensure Accurate Property Ownership**: Provide a reliable and immutable record of property ownership using GeoSpatial Coordinates and blockchain technology.
- [ ] **Facilitate Secure Transactions**: Enable secure and transparent property transactions, ensuring all transactions are validated and recorded on the blockchain.
- [ ] **Enhance Conflict Resolution**: Implement automated conflict detection and resolution mechanisms to handle disputes and overlapping claims efficiently.
- [ ] **Promote Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure all properties comply with local and national regulations, including environmental laws, through a comprehensive registration and verification process.

## Features

### Property Ownership and Identification

- [ ] **Geospatial Mapping**: Use latitude and longitude coordinates to accurately mark properties.
- [ ] **Unique Identifiers**: Assign unique identifiers to property owners for registration on the blockchain.
- [ ] **Ownership Proof**: Require proof of ownership during registration, including legal documents and previous records.
- [ ] **Multi-Ownership Support**: Allow properties to be co-owned by multiple individuals, with clear definitions of ownership shares.

### Property Transactions

- [ ] **Partial Land Sales**: Enable owners to sell smaller parts of a larger property by allocating new coordinates to the buyer.
- [ ] **Transaction Fees**: Implement a fee structure for all blockchain transactions.
- [ ] **Transaction Validation**: Use consensus mechanisms to validate all property transactions.
- [ ] **Historical Records**: Maintain a transparent and auditable history of all transactions on the blockchain.

### Property Registration

- [ ] **Verification Requirements**: Ensure all registration details are accurate and verified by authorized entities.
- [ ] **Immutable Records**: Prevent transfer of registered properties without transaction fee payment, even by government authorities.
- [ ] **Dispute Mechanism**: Provide a system for resolving property claims and transaction issues.

### Conflict Resolution

- [ ] **GPS Accuracy Check**: Verify the accuracy of GPS coordinates and check for possible conflicts.
- [ ] **Automated Detection**: Implement automated conflict detection to identify overlapping claims.
- [ ] **Resolution Timeline**: Establish a timeline for resolving conflicts, with penalties for delays.

### Security and Privacy

- [ ] **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all data related to property and transactions to ensure privacy and security.
- [ ] **Access Control**: Restrict access to modify property records to authorized individuals, with action logging.

### Environmental Considerations

- [ ] **Impact Assessments**: Conduct environmental impact assessments for large property transactions.
- [ ] **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure all properties comply with relevant local and national regulations, including environmental laws.

## Benefits

- [ ] **Transparency**: Provide a transparent and auditable record of property ownership and transactions.
- [ ] **Security**: Ensure the security of property data through encryption and access control.
- [ ] **Efficiency**: Streamline property transactions and conflict resolution with automated processes.
- [ ] **Regulatory Compliance**: Facilitate compliance with legal and environmental regulations through thorough verification and documentation.

By leveraging blockchain technology, this system will address the complexities and challenges associated with land ownership and transactions, providing a reliable and efficient platform for managing property records and transactions.
