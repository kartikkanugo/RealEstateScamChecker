# Guidelines for Avoiding Land Owned by an Individual

## Property Ownership and Identification

- A property can always be owned by an individual.
- Each property is marked using GeoSpatial Coordinates, such as latitude and longitude.
- Registration of property on the blockchain requires a unique identifier for the owner.
- Proof of ownership must be provided during registration, such as legal documents or previous registration records.
- Properties can be co-owned by multiple individuals, with each owner's share clearly defined and registered.

## Property Transactions

- If a large piece of land is owned by a user and they wish to sell a smaller part of it, the coordinates of the smaller piece are taken and allocated to the new owner. The land is deducted from the previous owner as well in the transaction
- Every transaction on the blockchain incurs a fee.
- All transactions must be validated by a consensus mechanism on the blockchain to ensure authenticity.
- Every transaction should maintain a historical record on the blockchain for transparency and auditability.

## Property Registration

- Registration of land on the blockchain can only be completed if the user has verified all details according to the requirements.
- Once a land is registered on the blockchain, it cannot be transferred to another user without payment of transaction fees, even by government authorities.
- Authorities must also pay transaction fees for any mistakes made.
- All details provided during registration must be accurate and verified by authorized entities.
- A dispute resolution mechanism should be in place for conflicts arising from property claims or transaction issues.

## Conflict Resolution

- If GPS coordinates are not accurate, a coordinate marked in the region is checked by the blockchain to identify possible conflicts. (This process still requires further investigation.)
- The system should have an automated conflict detection mechanism to identify overlapping claims and notify relevant parties.
- A specified timeline should be established for resolving conflicts, with penalties for delays.

## Security and Privacy

- All data related to property and transactions must be encrypted to ensure privacy and security.
- Only authorized individuals should have access to modify property records, and their actions should be logged has transactions on the block chain with a fees as well.

## Environmental Considerations

- Consider environmental impact assessments for large property transactions to ensure sustainable development.
- All properties must comply with local and national regulations, including environmental laws.
